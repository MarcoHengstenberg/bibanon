A year event where /a/ gets togetherAlthough not actually anime, /a/nons has gathered every Christmas since 2011 to give each other presents. The first two years, there were two different people managing the event (Sandy, Hudson) each year. Since then, it has become more advanced, with a dedicated group (SantaFaggot/SantaShota/SantaLoli) managing presents, cards, and addresses since 2013. There are still a few hurdles they have to beat, such as grinches (people who receive but do not give), constant hecklers telling them that what they are doing is not anime, and the fear of mods shutting down their operation.

This page is a list of pages that require fixing of some form.

**NOTE:** Some imported pages are historical relics that may look like unfinished projects. Double check before adding or editing a page here.

## Unfinished Projects / Pages
These pages are were started and have some content, but were abandoned. Some require continued attention.
* [Twitch Plays Pokemon](https://github.com/bibanon/Twitch-Plays/wiki) - What little is here should be placed on a page in bibanon
* [[4-ch]]
* [[4chan-History-Timeline]]
* [[4chan-Boards]]
* [[4chan-GET-Encyclopedia]]
* [[4chan-Mod-Memes]]
* [[4chan-Modern-Timeline]] - Merge with the actual timeline? Or link to new tanasin timeline
* [[4chan-Threads]]
* [[Anime]] - Page and subpages need to be converted to github wiki format
* [[Memes]] - Page and subpages need to be converted to github wiki format

## Needs Maintenance
Mostly pages imported from wikis that did not use Markdown format. May overlap with unfinished projects.
* [[4chan---Meme-Faces]]
* [[4chan-Anecdotes]] - There is a bad link to this page on the 4chan page
* [[4chan-Wordfilters]]
* [[711chan]]
* [[888chan]]
* [[A-Tsundere-Christmas-Carol]] - Merge with the [Tsundere Christmas Carol Page](https://github.com/bibanon/a-tsundere-christmas-carol/wiki)

## Empty Pages
Kind of ironic that the empty pages section is empty.

## Unsorted Pages
Completed pages that are not linked to by any page. For reference, all pages should be linked by the main pages in the sidebar, or any subpage of those.
* [[4chan---The-Facebook-Age]] - Sort into 4chan Chronicle
* [[4chan---The-Crackdown]]
* [[4chan-Modern-Era]]
* [[AIDS]] - Sort into memes?
* [[Secret-Santa]]

### Camgirls
Specific category of imported pages. While they were grouped back when the pages were on a wiki, now they are scattered. There may be other pages that share the same fate.
* [[People]] - Make new camgirls page from here
* [[1998-chan]]
* [[Acne-chan]]
* [[Afro-chan]]

## Misc Pages
If you have any doubts about whether a page should be edited, throw it here.
* [[3301-Reddit]] - Unfinished project? Not sure what this is.
* [[4chan-Milestones]] - Merge with the timeline
* [[4chan-Thread-Grabber]] - Merge with the actual archiver page
* [[About-4chan]] - Merge with 4chan

**Wikichan** is the logical extension of what are known as the "*chan" boards. These boards, primarily that of [[4chan]], have generated a kind of culture and demographic that has never been represented in any kind of documented form. Wikichan is the answer to that problem- Wikichan is a website dedicated to documenting *chan culture. With that, Wikichan has two purposes. One, to be a kind of collaboration of everything good from the *chan community- Copypasta, Stories, that sort of thing. Secondly, to serve as a basin for those who want to fag off on a Wiki, but really have no easy way to do so lest they be banned on other wikis (within reason).

## Content

We owe a lot to these guys, especially as inspiration and for our entire [[Stories]] section. Without Wikichan, many important stories pertaining to 4chan culture would have been forgotten, such as [[Damaged Goods]] or [[Blindmute Loli]].

## History

Wikichan was originally started in late 2006 as a kind of joke, a unique little way to document all sorts of *chan culture. While it has survived approximately three major downtimes and two losses of data (to the point where dedicated members have had to restore the database from Google's cache and Archive.org enough to make bots to do so), it has nonetheless carved itself popularity on the internet, scaring off most hosting companies except the ones with the balls to try hosting it.

The amount of blanking raid and DDoSes against Wikichan by [[420chan]], [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], and other no fun sites eventually caused it's demise. By the end of 2010,  [[Wikisysop]] gave up on the site and converted it into a men's self-help blog that few people read (based on [[The Well-Cultured Anonymous]]). What remains of Wikichan's most important content survives on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], the [[Internet Archive]], the [[LURKMOAR Wiki]], and of course, the Bibliotheca Anonoma.

In January 2012, the [[Yotsuba Society]] announced a plan to restore Wikichan's content to it's original state on [their own wiki](http://www.yswiki.org/wiki/). 30% of it was already been added, but the Yotsuba Society site had to be dissolved due to personal funding issues.

The Bibliotheca Anonoma, not wanting to repeat the mistakes of the past, was able to obtain a preemptive backup from the Yotsuba Society of this wiki in both SQL and XML import format. This YSWiki backup is as close as we will ever get to righting the wrongs of the past.

## Staff

The owner of Wikichan is the [[Wikisysop]], who created the original Wikichan wiki and hosted it on his own servers (which eventually fried). Wikichan was hosted by Carcer and his associates, who seemed to have a godlike ability to put up with all of the shit that Wikichan generated on a day-to-day basis. As well, there were approximately 10 Sysops, who managed the board and ensure the quality of all articles (and protect them from harassment from users angry at Wikichan).
